:summary: A Classic, Elegant, Sober and Strong typeface.
:description: The Quattrocento Roman typeface is a Classic, Elegant, Sober and Strong typeface.  Their wide and open letterforms, and the great x-height, make it very legible for body text at small sizes. And their tiny details that only shows up at bigger sizes make it also great for display use.
